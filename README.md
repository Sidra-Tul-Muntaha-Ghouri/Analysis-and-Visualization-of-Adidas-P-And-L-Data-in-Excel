# Analysis and Visualization of P&L Data in Excel

In this project, I've analyzed Adidas' P&L Data in Excel.

My role in this project is of a Financial Analyst, who has downloaded Bloomberg data and is asked to prepare a concise report and visualizations.

In this project, I used advanced Excel lookup functions, applied professional formatting, and created appealing charts to help management understand financial performance at first glance, which is challenging to do with this data. But these are the types of tasks a well-prepared analyst needs to be able to perform on the job.

Finally, I interpreted the firmâ€™s financials using trend and profitability margin analysis. 
Tested my ability to synthesize complex financial P&L data into easy-to-understand insights that can be presented to a professional audience.
